# CovidMachineLearning

Machine learning project covering wide range of knowledge I gain during one of my university courses.
Main goal of this project was carrying out predictions (in both global and local cases) in order to establish if it is possible using delivered data.

I used dataset of nearly 200k observations for a global case and 1k records for local one (Italy). I conducted EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to get to know data I had to deal with and pre-processed both sets in suitable way. After this part I used a lot of methods such as:

- linear regression
- multiple regression, 
- SVR 
- decision trees 
- random forest 

All of my work and it's results are documented in COVID_ML.ipynb file.
